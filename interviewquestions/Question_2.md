I would like to compare CRA (React.js) with CNA (Next.js)

Even though they seem as related technologies in the frontend development, they both serve for different purposes. I think the difference comes from the type of the project you are planning to build.

React.js has a component-based architecture. It’s like a toolkit for building the interactive parts of a website. You can also imagine React as using pre-made Lego pieces to create a big lego set. You can re-use those pre-made lego pieces in the other parts of your lego set. To be more technical, you can re-use the buttons, form and etc. that you build with React.js in different parts of your application again. You don’t have to re-create them. And It’s perfect for client-side-rendering applications, so if you are planning to build a single page web applications where client-side-rendering is enough for you, React.js is a really good option for that.

On the other hand, Next.js was built on top React.js. You can pretty much do everything you can with React.js in Next.js with additional features. Next.js focused on server-side-render meaning it renders your HTML document on the server side so your client doesn’t have to render your page by using JavaScript. On next.js, that process is happening on the server side, you don’t see it. That results in faster loading times. Also, if you are planning to implement navigation between pages, in React.js you would have to install external libraries and dependencies like React Router. But next.js comes as a full package, it has a built-in routing system so it makes really easy to create client-side navigations between pages.

Again, it just depends on the project you want to build. I will take Next.js as a big brother of React.js.
