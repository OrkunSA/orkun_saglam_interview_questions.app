title: '7) How could we improve or alter this familiarization exercise?'

I believe this exercise is already quite effective. It provides a good understanding of the platform and the role for which you are interviewing. The only potential alteration I can think of is to conduct these questions face-to-face with a real person in a timely manner, rather than providing written answers on a webpage built on Vercel. However, I understand that part of this exercise is to encourage candidates to use the product, which I find valuable. So, I have mixed feelings about this aspect. Overall, I found it to be a valuable and well-designed exercise.
